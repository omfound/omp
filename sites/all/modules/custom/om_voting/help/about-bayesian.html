<p>This station uses a bayesian average of voting information to schedule shows for broadcast playback. Bayesian averages differ from a plain average in that they allow other related existing factors to play a role. In your station's case your show's voting average is combined with the average of all other shows to produce an average rating that has less deviation from the show set as a whole. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_average" target="_blank">Read more.</a></p>
