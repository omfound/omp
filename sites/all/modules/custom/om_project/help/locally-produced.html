<p>Open Media Project collects metadata about the shows in your project such as theme, language, rating and locally produced. This metadata is very helpful to your station.</p>
<p>Checking locally-produced means the programming was created with your Organization's production facilities, OR was created by residents of your service area (or entities located within your service area) who did not use your Organization's production facilities.</p>
